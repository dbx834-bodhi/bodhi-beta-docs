# SFI 3.0 Compliance

The Schools Interoperability Framework, Systems Interoperability Framework (UK), or SIF, is a data sharing open specification for academic institutions from kindergarten through workforce. This specification is being used primarily in the United States, Canada, the UK, and Australia; however, it is increasingly being implemented in India, and elsewhere.

The specification is composed of two parts: an XML specification for modeling educational data which is specific to the educational locale (such as North America, Australia or UK), and a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) specification based on both direct and brokered RESTful-models for sharing that data between institutions, which is international and shared between the locales.

SIF is not a product, but an industry initiative that enables diverse applications to interact and share data. Please read the [about article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_Interoperability_Framework).
