## Benefits of Consistent Style

"Countless hours have been spent by developers throughout the years arguing over single vs. double quotes, where to put brackets, how many spaces to type, and all kinds of other cosmetic code style questions. These are all questions that have at best a tangential relationship to code quality, but are very easy to have opinions about because they are so visual."

"While itâ€™s not necessarily important whether your code base uses single or double quotes for string literals, there are huge benefits to making that decision once and having it be consistent across your organization. These benefits also apply to the Meteor and JavaScript development communities as a whole."
